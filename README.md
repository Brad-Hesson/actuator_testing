# Actuator Testing Software

This is a repository to hold the scripts and programs I am writing to be able to test the actuators that we build.  All of the actual data is in the [.gitignore](https://github.com/Brad-Hesson/actuator_testing/blob/master/.gitignore) so that no data is ever pushed to this repository.

## It has scripts for:
- Generating the waverforms we use to drive the actuators during testing
- Analysing the data aquired from those tests
- Displaying and presenting the analysed data
