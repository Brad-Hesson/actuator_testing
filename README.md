# Actuator Testing Software

This is a repo to hold the scripts and programs i am writing to be able to test the actuators that we build.

## It has scripts for:
- Generating the waverforms we use to drive the actuators during testing
- Analysing the data aquired from those tests
- Displaying the analysed data
